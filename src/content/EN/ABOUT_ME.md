# About Me

Hi! My name is Florian Schnell and I am a software engineer with most experience in the area of cloud infrastructure, DevOps, software architecture, data engineering, frontend development (Angular & React), backend development (Java, Python, Node.js, Scala ...), embedded development (C/C++, Rust, DirectX & OpenGL) and agile teamwork. I like to spend my spare time also on sports (running, road cycling, swimming, climbing ...), travelling and dolce vita (namely espresso and tagliatelle).

## Education

After I completed school and a nine months long civil service at our local city maintanance department, I started my studies of computer science at the University of Applied Science Kempten. <mark>In the summer of 2012</mark> I handed in my thesis on *"Analysis and implementation of different methods for the computation of light and shadow in the area of computergraphics"* and subsequently got awarded a <mark>Bachelor of Science</mark>.

Afterwards, I took on a study to get a master's degree in computer science at the University of Augsburg. During my time in Augsburg I was working big parts at the chair of Software Engineering in the research area of self organizing adaptive systems. Eventually, I finished <mark>2015 and received a Master of Science</mark> degree. The topic of my master thesis was a *"Decentral solution of a partitioning problem to form virtual powerplants"*.

## Wroking Experience

Already during my studies I founded a company with three acquaintances that we called *visitcity Ltd*. Our main product was a map application, which made it possible for regional partners (like cities or touristic regions) to visualize and use the data that lay hidden within internal geographical information systems (GIS) to support and boost tourism. We received financial support through Intergraph (Germany), a worldwide known company, which is acting within the domain of spatial information management.

As part of my study I spent my practical semester 2010 at *NADEO*, a french video game company which belongs to the publisher *UBISOFT*, in Paris. During my 6 months stay, I implemented together with two other employees a successor to my hobby project *Aseco*, a tool called *ManiaLive*. The purpose of this software was to improve the online experience of the game *Trackmania* (which is a well known racing game, see http://www.trackmania.com). ManiaLive extended the game with the recording of best times and the possibility of in-game server administration through a nice graphical UI.

During and after writing my bachelor thesis I have been working for one year at the University of Applied Science Kempten. This encompassed the setting up of a CAVE (*Cave Automatic Virtual Environment*) and looking after a seminar class that developed the first application for this installation with the use of C++ and the Equalizer framework (http://eyescale.github.io/equalizergraphics.com/).

<mark>Since the summer of 2015 I am now working with *Netlight*</mark> (http://www.netlight.com), a swedish IT consultancy, that has an office in Munich. Netlight has a lot of projects and interesting clients, a very modern company structure as well as the most beautiful colleagues, who I share a lot of important values with.
