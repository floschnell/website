# About Me
I am a 28 year old software engineer. My area of competence reaches from frontend development (webdesign, UI-design, rendering ...) over the architecture and implementation of the application's backend (server-side rendering, APIs, databases, SOA & microservices ...) to more hardware near computing (OpenCL, DirectX, Assembler ...).

This great variety of knowledge on the one hand results from my intensive study of computer science, during which I could pursue my unconstrained interest in IT. On the other hand I was always working on some side projects, which I would challenge on my own or together in smaller teams. Furthermore I can already look back onto some years of working experience that I had in different domains.

Within my spare time I like to travel, do sports like cycling, running or climbing or to relax while doing some fixing/handiwork/good espresso.

## Education
After I completed my nine months civil service at our local city maintanance department I started my studies of computer science at the University of Applied Science Kempten. <mark>In the summer of 2012</mark> I handed in my thesis on *"Analysis and implementation of different methods for the computation of light and shadow in the area of computergraphics"* and finally got awarded a <mark>Bachelor of Science</mark>.

Afterwards I took on a study to get a master's degree in computer science at the University of Augsburg. During my time in Augsburg I was working a big part at the chair of Software Engineering in the research area of self organizing adaptive systems. Eventually I finished <mark>2015 and received a Master of Science</mark> degree. The topic of my master thesis was a *"Decentral solution of a partitioning problem to form virtual powerplants"*.

## Wroking Experience
Already during my studies I found a company with three acquaintances that we called *visitcity Ltd*. Our main product was a map application, which made it possible for regional partners (like cities or touristic regions) to visualize and use the data that lay hidden within internal geographical information systems to support and boost tourism. We received financial support through Intergraph (Germany), a worldwide known company, which is acting within the domain of spatial information management.

As part of my study I spend my practical semester 2010 at *NADEO*, a french video game company which belongs to the publisher *UBISOFT*, in Paris. During my stay, that took 6 months I implemented together with two other employees a tool called "ManiaLive". The purpose of this software was to improve the online experience of the game *Trackmania* (which is a well known racing game, see http://www.trackmania.com). It extended the game with the recording of best times, the possibility of in-game administration of the server and a nice graphical UI.

During and after writing my bachelor thesis I have been working for one year at the University of Applied Science Kempten. This encompassed the setting up of a CAVE (*Cave Automatic Virtual Environment*) and looking after a seminar class that developed the first application for this installation with the use of c++ and the Equalizer framework (http://eyescale.github.io/equalizergraphics.com/).

<mark>Since the summer of 2015 I am now working with *Netlight*</mark> (http://www.netlight.com), a swedish IT consultancy, that has an office in Munich. Netlight has a lot of projects and interesting clients, a very modern company structure as well as the most beautiful colleagues who I share a lot of important values with.
